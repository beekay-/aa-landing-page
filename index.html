                <p>Hey man. Welcome to Alpha Aesthetics. I’m Omar, former socially-rejected fat boy turned Muscular Casanova. The Ayatollah of Aesthetics. Creator of Male Sex Symbols. But those are only my official, state-decreed titles. My friends call me Bromar. Since you’re reading this, that includes you now.

Chances are, if you found me, I know you pretty well. Even though we’ve never met. You have a deep yearning to be better than average. To be alpha. To be the best, in every area of your life. Of course, part of being the best man you can be is to have a muscular, powerful body that inspires swooning from the ladies and fear in your enemies.

Whether you’re looking to lose fat or build muscle, I’ve been in your shoes. I’ve done both, and I’ve dealt with the psychological aspect of being fat AND being skinny. Oh yeah, I’m also a former Psychology Ph.D. student (but that’s a story for another time). I can give you something that guys who came out of the womb with a six pack and huge guns don’t have – motivation to keep at it, even if you feel like you are not making enough progress.</p>
